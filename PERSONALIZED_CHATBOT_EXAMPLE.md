### Example AI Response:

```
Hi John! Based on your progress today, you're doing great with your weight loss goal! You've consumed 650 calories so far (33% of your 2000-calorie target), which gives you plenty of room for a satisfying lunch.

Looking at your current macros, I notice you're a bit low on protein (only 17% of your 150g goal), so let's focus on a protein-rich lunch that will help you feel full and support your weight loss.

Here are some perfect lunch options for you:

ü•ó **Grilled Chicken Salad Bowl** (recommended)
- 150g grilled chicken breast (~250 kcal, 45g protein)
- Mixed greens, cucumber, tomatoes
- 1 tbsp olive oil dressing (~120 kcal)
- Total: ~370 kcal, 45g protein

This would bring you to:
- Calories: 1020/2000 (51%) ‚úÖ
- Protein: 70g/150g (47%) ‚úÖ Much better!

üêü **Alternative: Salmon & Quinoa**
- 120g baked salmon (~240 kcal, 30g protein)
- 80g cooked quinoa (~110 kcal, 4g protein)
- Steamed broccoli (~25 kcal)
- Total: ~375 kcal, 34g protein

Given your moderately active lifestyle and the fact that you've been eating healthy foods like Greek yogurt and almonds, these options will keep you on track with your weight loss goal while ensuring you get enough protein to maintain muscle mass.

Would you like me to suggest some specific recipes or help you plan your dinner based on what you choose for lunch?
